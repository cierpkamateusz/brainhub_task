Recruitment task server

# Requirements
All what you need is installed node, npm and running local mongoDB.

# Installation
Clone repository and simply run "npm install" command.

config.env is a configuration file. You can specify: 
  - PORT in which server will listen,
  - DATABASE db url

default config:
PORT=3001
DATABASE=mongodb://localhost:27017/recruitment

# Starting server
You can start server by typing "npm start"

In case of 'prettier' problems with CRLF on Windows, just remove .eslintrc.json file :)
